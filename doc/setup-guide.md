# Setup guide
This document describes about Beluganos's setup for hardware (white-box switches).

## Pre-requirements
- Please refer [install-guide.md](install-guide.md) before proceeding.

## Config files at a glance

The files under `etc/playbooks/` are configuration files. In this page, `dp-*.yml` and the files under `roles/dpath/` are described.

## Settings for white-box switches

### 1. edit playbook

**The sample playbook is `etc/playbooks/dp-sample.yml`**. You may copy sample file and rename this playbook. Any switch name (dpname) are acceptable, and this name is only used for internal configurations. If your switch name is *switchA*, please edit as follows:

~~~~
$ cd ~/beluganos/etc/playbooks
$ cp dp-sample.yml dp-switchA.yml
$ vi dp-switchA.yml

---

- hosts: hosts
  connection: local
  roles:
    - { role: dpath, dpname: switchA, mode: fibc }
  tags:
    fibc

~~~~

The syntax of this playbook is following:

~~~~
- hosts: hosts
  connection: local
  roles:
    - { role: dpath, dpname: <switch-name>, mode: fibc }
  tags:
    fibc
~~~~

- roles
	- dpname (`<switch-name>`): Your preferable switch name (A-Z,a-z,0-9,_-). Do not contain space.

### 2. edit switch type
**The sample configuration files are under `etc/playbooks/roles/dpath/files/sample_sw`**. The files under `roles/dpath` will determine the type of white-box switches. Beluganos will optimize the writing method to FIB for each switch type. If your switch's name is *switchA*, you may copy sample file and rename to dpname as follows:

~~~~
$ cd ~/beluganos/etc/playbooks
$ cp -r roles/dpath/files/sample_sw roles/dpath/files/switchA
$ vi roles/dpath/files/switchA/fibc.yml

---

datapaths:
  - name: switchA           # dpname (A-Z,a-z,0-9,_-)
    dp_id: 14               # datapath id of your switches (integer)
    mode: generic           # "ofdpa2" or "generic" or "ovs"

~~~~

The syntax of `etc/playbooks/roles/dpath/files/<switch-name>/fibc.yml` is following:

~~~~
datapaths:
  - name: <switch-name>     # dpname (A-Z,a-z,0-9,_-)
    dp_id: <switch-dp-id>   # datapath id of your switches (integer)
    mode: <switch-type>     # "ofdpa2" or "generic" or "onsl" or "ovs"
~~~~


The value of `dp-id` means OpenFlow datapath ID of your switch. The value of `mode` should be edited for your switch types. You can choose following options:

- datapaths
	- name (`<switch-name>`): Your switch name which is already declared in `etc/playbooks/dp-switchA.yml`.
	- dp_id (`<switch-dp-id>`): OpenFlow datapath ID of your switch. Integer.
	- mode (`<switch-type>`): Your switch types. Currently Beluganos has three options.
 		1. `ofdpa2`: OF-DPA 2.0 switch.
 		1. `onsl` : OpenNSL 3.5 switch.
		1. `generic`: OpenFlow 1.3 compatible switches. (e.g. Lagopus)
		1. `ovs`: Open vSwitch (Limited support).

### Reflect changes

In case `<switch-name>` is *switchA*:

~~~~
$ cd ~/beluganos/etc/playbooks
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts -K dp-switchA.yml
~~~~
